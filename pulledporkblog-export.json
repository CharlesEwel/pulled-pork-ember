      "content" : "I feel a little guilty about the less than stellar three star rating I am giving, but I just can't bring myself to jump on the Bunk bandwagon. It was kind of a let down...  To be fair, my brother and I decided that the original Bunk would be the best, despite the fact that we were unaware that the other locations offered different sandwiches and (more) sides.   We ordered the pulled pork, chicken salad, and Italian cured meat sandwich and split each one. Lest you think we're huge pigs, you should know that these sandwiches are not large by any stretch of the imagination. We downed these three just fine and had room to spare. ",

Brian was responsive and accommodating - which was essential, since we were organizing this party from Dublin, Ireland. The Mississippi Crew couldn't have been nicer. They were professional, and served with big smiles, even though they were working on the 4th of July. They were there early, and stayed late. ",

People crowd around the bar and with the outdoor seating it becomes standing room only at the front, but we've never waiting for a table.   Service is always friendly here. They have Dr. Pepper made with real sugar and everything is service with a slice of cornbread. The meat is tender, you don't even need a fork. My favorite side is the green chile mac-n-cheese. YUM!

I've been here 5 times and it's consistently been \"ok.\"   The brisket is cooked well and is juicy but lacks a depth of flavor. The st Louis ribs fall off the bone but have dry tough bits as well. I've had a couple bites where I'm like \"woah that was a good bite,\" only to find myself searching for another illusive bite.   The sauces: 2 different kinds both of which will never win any awards. KFC bbq sauce is better. Don't get me wrong I've tried almost every niche small batch bbq sauce at whole foods and KFC bbq sauce trumps em all. ",

I could not have asked for more out of a BBQ joint. This is a must when in London.  The portions are also large as well for those who are annoyed with European portions. The place itself is not that large so you may want to call ahead about seating. If you don't, grab a beer and people watch while waiting. I'll go back for sure!",

It was hotter inside than outside (on an 80-degree summer day). There are about four chairs if you want to eat in, so I gather most people order and take food home.",

There was a glitch with our order, and it was handled well.  That's impressive to me.  As for the food, it was great!  I am not generally a bbq person, but we were impressed with their ribs and sauce at Ribfest a few weeks ago, so we decided to visit the actual restaurant.  We'd assumed it was a waiter-service establishment that might be expensive to go to frequently, but were delighted to find that  instead it's a reasonably-priced, charming, and well-appointed counter-service place where they bring out your order to your table.  We both had the burnt-ends brisket sandwiches; I had mac n' cheese as my side, and my husband had the mashed potatoes with gravy.   We will definitely be back!!",
